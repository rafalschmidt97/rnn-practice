## Stay at home - pollution prediction in US

Before running the script you have to download
the dataset there from kaggle and add it to /data directory.

In this example I decided to choose [U.S. Pollution Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution)
dataset to predict future air quality and suggest people to stay at home or not.

> This dataset deals with pollution in the U.S. Pollution in the U.S. has been well documented by the U.S. EPA but it is a pain to download all the data and arrange them in a format that interests data scientists. Hence I gathered four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone) for every day from 2000 - 2016. There is a total of 28 fields. The four pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2 and O3) each has 5 specific columns. Observations totaled to over 1.4 million.
