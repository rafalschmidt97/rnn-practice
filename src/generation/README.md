## Text Generation

Before running the script you have to download
the dataset there from kaggle and add it to /data directory.

In this example I have used [freeCodeCamp Gitter Chat](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/all-posts-public-main-chatroom)
dataset to perform basic text generation. 

> The files contains the posts from students, bots, moderators and contributors in the main ("/freeCodeCamp") Gitter chatroom between 31-Dec-2014 until the first days of Dec-2017. There are around 5 million posts from near 400,000 users (all estimates). Data was extracted using Python code over the Gitter API. Records are not anonymised or modified and are presented "as they are".
