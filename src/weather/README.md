## Brazil Weather Forecast

Before running the script you have to download
the dataset there from kaggle and add it to /data directory.

In this example I decided to choose [Brazil Weather (1961 - 2019)](https://www.kaggle.com/saraivaufc/conventional-weather-stations-brazil)
dataset to predict future weather. If there's gonna be more time maybe some sort of suggesting mechanism like "should I take an umbrela?"

> Meteorological data observed in conventional meteorological stations of the National Institute of Meteorology - INMET distributed in the Brazilian territory from 1961 to 2019.
