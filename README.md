Time to learn Machine Learning baby! 
As part of my bachelor thesis is correlated to Recurrent Neural Network I want to practice a bit
before writing something serious. So feel free to explore it but do not expect high quality code here.

There are three experiments here:
- [text generation](src/generation/README.md) on top of chat conversations
- [weather forecasting](src/weather/README.md)
- [air quality index prediction](src/air-quality/README.md)

## Getting started

After cloning the repository create a virtual environment and run:
```console
python setup.py install
```

For more information go to project specific documentation in the src directory. 

## Contributing guidelines

The document is heavily inspired by Angular Contributing. Take a look [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
