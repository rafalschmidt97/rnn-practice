Time to learn Machine Learning baby! 
As part of my bachelor thesis is correlated to Recurrent Neural Network I want to practice a bit
before writing something serious. So feel free to explore it but do not expect high quality code here.

There are three exercises in the plan:
- text generation on top of some chat conversation
- weather forecasting with suggestions what to wear
- decision making of going outside with air condition dataset

## Getting started

After cloning the repository create a virtual environment and run:
```console
python setup.py install
```

## Contributing guidelines

The document is heavily inspired by Angular Contributing. Take a look [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
